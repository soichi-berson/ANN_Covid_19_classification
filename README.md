# ANN (Covid 19 Classification)
Experiments of ANN using datasets of medical chest X-rays.

## Introduction
This is an AI project using Python, conducted by Soichiro Tanabe based on the studies from the Open University module: 'AI and Machine Learning'.

## Data Sources
Kaggle ([available from Kaggle](https://doi.org/10.34740/kaggle/dsv/3122958))

## Research Objectives

1. Develop neural network models leveraging a dataset of medical chest X-rays, categorized into three classes: Covid-19 cases, non-Covid chest infections (bacterial or viral pneumonia), and cases with no lung infection.
2. Investigate the different behavior of models on both seen and unseen data to discern their performance variations.
3. Investigate how different hyperparameters can affect a modelâ€™s performance.
